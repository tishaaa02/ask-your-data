# Ask Your Data — Virtual Data Analyst App

**Ask Your Data** is an interactive analytics tool that lets users upload a dataset and ask questions using natural language. The app automatically performs EDA, generates charts, provides plain-English insights, and outputs SQL queries for reproducibility.

---

## 🚀 Why this project
Many companies have data but no quick way to obtain accurate, explainable insights. This app reduces the time-to-insight by automating common analysis steps and communicating results in business-friendly language.

---

## 🔧 What it does
- Auto-detects schema and data types
- Runs automated EDA (missingness, distributions, correlations)
- Generates plots and downloadable PNG/CSV outputs
- Produces plain-English insights and suggested next steps
- (Optional) Uses an LLM to translate natural language questions to SQL for DuckDB
